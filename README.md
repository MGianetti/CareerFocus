# QikServe Front end Test

This project is a demonstration of a modern, best-practice React development setup. It uses TypeScript for safer, more maintainable code, Vite for a blazing-fast development experience and hot-reloading, and React Testing Library for writing tests that validate the app's functionality in a way that mirrors how users interact with it.
